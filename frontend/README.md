### ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on the Live Demo Database

* This project was developed and tested using **MySQL** as per the assignment requirements.
* For the live demo, a **free Postgres (Neon)** database is used as a substitute, as free hosted MySQL instances are no longer readily available.
* The backend code is configured for **MySQL** by default. To run this project locally, please follow the MySQL setup instructions below.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dashboard:** View quick statistics on your collection (Total Entries, Total Movies, Total TV Shows).
* **Full CRUD:** Add, Edit, and Delete entries with user-friendly modals.
* **True Infinite Scroll:** The table automatically fetches new entries as you scroll, using `react-intersection-observer` to detect scroll position and display skeleton loaders.
* **Duplicate Prevention:** The backend API checks for duplicate entries (based on title and year) before creating a new one.
* **Robust Validation:** Both frontend (with `React Hook Form` + `Zod`) and backend (with `Zod`) validation for all user input.
* **Modern UI:** Built with **Shadcn UI** and Tailwind CSS, including dark mode support.
* **Real-time Feedback:** Uses `sonner` (toast notifications) for all user actions (create, update, delete, error).

## üì¶ Setup and Installation

This project is in two parts: `backend` and `frontend`. You must run both locally.

### 1. Backend (Local MySQL Setup)

**This is the required setup for the assignment.**

1.  **Navigate to the `backend` folder:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your MySQL Database:**
    * Make sure you have a local MySQL server running (e.g., MySQL Workbench, XAMPP).
    * Create a new, empty database named `movie_db`.

4.  **Configure Environment:**
    * Create a new file named `.env` in the `backend` folder.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if it exists) or use the template below.
    * Edit your `.env` file with your MySQL connection string:

    ```env
    # .env
    DATABASE_URL="mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/movie_db"
    
    # Example for a default local MySQL:
    # DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:your_password_here@localhost:3306/movie_db"
    ```

5.  **Run Database Migration:**
    This command will create all the tables in your `movie_db`.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

6.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    ‚úÖ The server will be running at `http://localhost:3001`

### 2. Frontend

1.  **Open a new terminal.**
2.  **Navigate to the `frontend` folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment:**
    * The `.env` file in the `frontend` folder is already set up to connect to your local backend. Its contents should be:
    ```env
    VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
    ```

5.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    ‚úÖ The app will be running at `http://localhost:5173`

You can now open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser and use the full application.
